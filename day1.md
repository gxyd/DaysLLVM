LLVM Day1
=========

It's currently 5:20PM, it's quite overwhelming to look at any aspect of LLVM right now, so many things to learn
with regards to any aspect that I look at, I don't know where to begin. Fumbling from here to there and back
again, it's been quite a juggernaut of a ride. Ok, let's think of it fresh, and start with one thing that I can
think of currently to start with and just stick with it.

Let's get this out of the way now, I'm on a journey to contribute to LLVM over the course of next couple of
months and it starts today. I don't know shit about anything just yet, but guess what I've to make it work. I
just do, I don't see anything else as a bigger priority that this. Ok, enough of the motivational shit and get
started with working. I'll update for what I ended up doing and I'm now going to close this day1.md blog post
so that I can get started with the things.

I'm going to start by watching the video [2019 LLVM Developers’ Meeting “Introduction to LLVM”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5xExRGaIIY).

I'll update about it tomorrow, see you.

See you tomorrow, bye bye.
